ðŸ¥’ PHPKL - Apple's PKL binding in PHP
=====================================

[![PHPUnit](https://github.com/alexandre-daubois/phpkl/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexandre-daubois/phpkl/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

This is a PHP binding for Apple's PKL language. This library uses the official PKL CLI tool from Apple and
provides a PHP interface to it.

This library is still in development and is not yet ready for production use.

## Installation

You can install this library using composer:

```bash
composer require alexandre-daubois/phpkl
```

The CLI tool must be installed on your system. You can either install it manually and set the `PKL_CLI_BIN`
environment variable to the path of the binary or use the `--download` option of the `pkl` command to download
the latest supported version of the PKL CLI tool into the `vendor/bin` directory.

```bash
vendor/bin/pkl --download
```

You can also set the download location by using the `--location` option:

```bash
vendor/bin/pkl --download --location=/usr/local/bin
```

If you do so, you must set the `PKL_CLI_BIN` environment variable to the path of the binary.

## Usage

The main way to use this library is to evaluate PKL code. You can do this by using the `evaluate` method of the
`Pkl` class.

### Basic Usage with PklModule

Let's say you have the following PKL code:

```pkl
/// config/simple.pkl

name = "Pkl: Configure your Systems in New Ways"
attendants = 100
isInteractive = true
amountLearned = 13.37
```

You can evaluate this code like this:

```php
use Phpkl\Pkl;

$module = Pkl::eval('config/simple.pkl');

// you can then interact with the module
echo $module->get('name'); // Pkl: Configure your Systems in New Ways
echo $module->get('attendants'); // 100
echo $module->get('isInteractive'); // true
echo $module->get('amountLearned'); // 13.37
```

This also works with nested modules:

```pkl
/// config/nested.pkl

woodPigeon {
    name = "Common wood pigeon"
    diet = "Seeds"
    taxonomy {
        species = "Columba palumbus"
    }
}
```

```php
use Phpkl\Pkl;

$module = Pkl::eval('config/nested.pkl');

// you can then interact with the module
echo $module->get('woodPigeon')->get('name'); // Common wood pigeon
echo $module->get('woodPigeon')->get('diet'); // Seeds
echo $module->get('woodPigeon')->get('taxonomy')->get('species'); // Columba palumbus
```

## Cast to other types

You can cast the values to other types using the `cast` method with a class
representing your data. Let's take the following PKL code:

```pkl
myUser {
    id = 1
    name = "John Doe"
    address {
        street = "123 Main St"
        city = "Springfield"
        state = "IL"
        zip = "62701"
    }
}
```

You can cast this to a `User` class like this:

```php
use Phpkl\Pkl;

class User
{
    public int $id;
    public string $name;
    public Address $address;
}

class Address
{
    public string $street;
    public string $city;
    public string $state;
    public string $zip;
}

$module = Pkl::eval('config/user.pkl');
$user = $module->get('myUser')->cast(User::class);
```

You can also pass `User::class` as the second argument to the `eval` method. This will automatically cast the module to
the given class. Beware that it returns an array indexed by the PKL instance name:

```php
use Phpkl\Pkl;

// ...

$user = Pkl::eval('config/user.pkl', User::class)['myUser'];
```

## The `PklProperty` attribute

You can use the `PklProperty` attribute to specify the name of the property in the PKL file. This is useful when the
property name in the PKL file is different from the property name in the PHP class. Let's take the following PKL code:

```pkl
myUser {
    id = 1
    name = "John Doe"
    address {
        street = "123 Main St"
        city = "Springfield"
        state = "IL"
        zip = "62701"
    }
}
```

You can define a `User` class like this:

```php
use Phpkl\PklProperty;

class User
{
    #[PklProperty('id')]
    public int $userId;

    #[PklProperty('name')]
    public string $userName;

    public Address $address;
}
```

When casting, the `PklProperty` attribute will be used to map the property name in the PKL file to the property
name in the PHP class.
